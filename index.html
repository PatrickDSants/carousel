             <Machine class="parag">Machine learning (ML) is a subcategory of artificial intelligence that refers to the process by which computers develop pattern recognition or the ability to continually learn or make predictions based on data, and then make adjustments without being specifically programmed for that. </p>

                <h2 class="title">How does machine learning work?</h2>
                <p class="parag">Machine learning is incredibly complex and how it works varies depending on the task and the algorithm used to perform it. However, at its core, a machine learning model is a computer that analyzes data, identifies patterns, and then uses those insights to better complete its assigned task. Any task that depends on a set of data points or rules can be automated using machine learning, even those more complex tasks like answering customer service calls and reviewing resumes.</p>

              <h2 class="title">How are deep learning and machine learning related?</h2>
              <p class="parag">Machine learning is the broadest category of algorithms that are able to take a set of data and use it to identify patterns, discover insights, and/or make predictions. deep learning is a specific branch of machine learning that uses ML functionality and goes beyond its capabilities.</p>
